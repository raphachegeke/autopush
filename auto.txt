Here's a short JavaScript snippet that logs the current date and time to the console:

```javascript
console.log(new Date());
```

**How it works:**

1.  `new Date()`: This creates a new `Date` object, which by default represents the current date and time at the moment it's created.
2.  `console.log()`: This function outputs the value of its argument to the browser's developer console or Node.js terminal. When a `Date` object is logged directly, it typically outputs a human-readable string representation of the date and time.

**Example Output (will vary based on your locale and time):**

```
Wed Jul 24 2024 10:30:45 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)
```

**Bonus: If you want specific formats, here are a few options:**

```javascript
const now = new Date();

// Default output (as above)
console.log("Default:", now);

// Just the date part (localized)
console.log("Local Date:", now.toLocaleDateString());

// Just the time part (localized)
console.log("Local Time:", now.toLocaleTimeString());

// Both date and time (localized)
console.log("Local Date & Time:", now.toLocaleString());

// ISO 8601 format (standardized, good for APIs)
console.log("ISO Format:", now.toISOString());

// UTC string
console.log("UTC String:", now.toUTCString());
```
